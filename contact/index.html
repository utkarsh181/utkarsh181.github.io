    <h2>Encryption for email</h2>
    <p>
      You can use GPG to encrypt mail, you can get my public keys
      <a href="https://github.com/utkarsh181/utkarsh181.github.io/blob/master/pgpkeys.txt">here</a>.
      Save it to a file, say <code>utkarsh.keys</code> and run the the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>gpg --import utkarsh.keys</pre>
    <p>
      Make sure to <strong>send me your public key</strong> as
      attachment, else I will not be able to reply to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I encourage you to learn how to use encryption for your email
      communications and establish it as your default method for trusted
      contacts.  You do not need to be a tech wizard to implement it.  Get
      started with this excellent guide by the Free Software Foundation on
      <a href="https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/">email self-defence</a>.
